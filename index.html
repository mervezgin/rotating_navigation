            <h1>GOOD OLD FILM PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
            <small>4 TIPS FOR BEGINNERS</small>

            <h4>#1 Use 35mm</h4>
            <h5>35mm has been the dominant film type since Leica standardized the format in the 1920s. 35mm, also known as 135 film, consists of a roll of film held inside a metal/plastic canister. The canister prevents the film from being exposed before or after loading, and is much less prone to failure than the paper backs of other formats.</h5>

            <h4>#2 Learn the exposure triangle rule(ISO/APERTURE/SHUTTER SPEED)</h4>
            <h5>In photography, the exposure triangle explains the relationship between shutter speed, ISO and aperture. Whether you're shooting old school film or with a mirrorless, these three factors are at the center of every exposure.</h5>

            <h4>#3 Learn how to use focus by trial and error</h4>
            <h5>Learning happens through trial and error. You take one step at a time, sometimes succeeding, but often slipping up. When you make a mistake, you have an opportunity to grow.</h5>

            <h4>#4 Rely on frames, leading lines, and the Golden Ratio rule</h4>
            <h5>The golden spiral is a compositional tool. It is also known as the Fibonacci spiral or golden ratio. The golden spiral is part of every natural object. It can be written as a mathematical equation of A ÷ B = (A + B) ÷ A = 1.61803398875. In a short form ratio, it is 1:1.618.</h5>

            <p>The term ‘Analogue Photography’ refers to photography using an analogue camera and film. A roll of film is loaded into the camera and the magic begins once you start clicking: light interacts with the chemicals in the film and an image is recorded. The pictures collected in your film roll come to life when the film is processed in a photo lab.</p>
